	<article class="aboutMe">
		<p>Improvement drives me. I am a very curious person who is always willing to learn something new and acknowledges that every individual has something to add to my life. On the opposite direction, as a trained instructor, I have developed strong didactics and find it very useful in dealing with teams.</p>

		<p>Both development and Agile are both work and fun for me and mixing those two topics deeply energizes me.</p>

		<p>The passion for improvement is certainly applied to work, and not limited to it. For that reason, I have a quite wide personal background, from ballroom dancing to skydiving. It pleases me and gives me a broad range of subjects I am comfortable with.</p>

		<h2>Developer</h2>
		<p>As a developer, I have worked in quite a number of projects. Most of them are web focused and have Java as a primary language, but I still consider myself a tecnology agnostic developer. My personal highlights for (opensource) projects follow:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Agile Brazil Schedule Builder</h3>
				<p>As the Program Chair at Agile Brazil, I decided to build a simple schedule builder from a json input. It is "front-end only", for now, but it will grow into a full stack soon-ish, so we can provide mobile notifications and the scheduling itself.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Calopsita</h3>
				<p>My graduation project was yet another agile project management tool and I am still in love with the simple practice we created to write remarkably legible tests in a BDD fashion, with compilation safety which natural language tests often lack.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Tubaina</h3>
				<p>This textbook generator reads from a simple markup syntax and outputs many formats: pdf, html, mobi or epub. This was the first commercial software I have built, and it is still in use for generating Caelum's textbooks and Casa do CÃ³digo books.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
