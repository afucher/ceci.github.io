				Improvement drives me. As an educator in many different ways, I am very pleased to see people I taught make their own steps towards a better understanding of the subject -- to that extent, I do my best in developing better didactics.

				I am also a very curious person who is always willing to learn something new and acknowledges that every individual has something to add to my life. This curiosity is not limited to work and it is the reason why I have a quite wide personal background, from ballroom dancing to skydiving. It pleases me and gives me a broad range of subjects I am comfortable with.
