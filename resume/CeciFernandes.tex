	\item{\textbf{Speaker at conferences}\\
	\indent{I am a frequent speaker in conferences concerning Agile methods and software development mostly because of a strong belief that knowledge is best when spread. I have given talks and workshops at Agile Brazil, Agile Trends, Caipira Agil, Agile in Rio, QCon, and the Agile conference, with topics ranging from process evolution, Agile principles, practices, and team building, to much more technical subjects such as whether the test pyramid make sense on a microservice world or not.
	}}\\
	\item{\textbf{Volunteer at conferences}\\
	\indent{
	Volunteering is my favorite way of participating in conferences and meeting interesting and motivated people. I have been a volunteer at QCon San Francisco and New York, XP Madrid, and many other Brazilian conferences. What I find particularly exciting about it, is that volunteer programs often show that providing people autonomy can extract the best from them.

{\large\textbf{About me}} \hspace{0.5em}\hrulefill

\\Improvement drives me. I am a very curious person who is always willing to learn something new and acknowledges that every individual has something to add to my life. As a trained and seasoned instructor, I have developed strong didactics, which I also find very useful while dealing with teams.

\\Software development and Agile are both work and fun for me and mixing those two topics deeply energizes me.

\\My passion for improvement is certainly applied to work, and not limited to it. For that reason, I have a quite wide personal background, from ballroom dancing to skydiving. Learning and trying new activities makes me happy, and gives me a broad range of subjects I am comfortable with.
