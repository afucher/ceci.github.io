I have been a volunteer at QCon San Francisco 2010 and 2013, XP Madrid 2011, QCon New York 2012, and many other Brazilian conferences and what I find particularly exciting about it is that volunteer programs often show that providing people autonomy can extract the best from them.

{\large\textbf{About me}} \hspace{0.5em}\hrulefill

\\Improvement drives me. I am a very curious person who is always willing to learn something new and acknowledges that every individual has something to add to my life. As a trained and seasoned instructor, I have developed strong didactics, which I also find very useful while dealing with teams.

\\Software development and Agile are both work and fun for me and mixing those two topics deeply energizes me.

\\Also, the passion for improvement is certainly applied to work, and not limited to it. For that reason, I have a quite wide personal background, from ballroom dancing to skydiving. Learning and trying new activities makes me happy, and gives me a broad range of subjects I am comfortable with.
